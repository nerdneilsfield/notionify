# Inline Formatting Combinations

## Bold and Italic Together

This is ***bold and italic*** in one span.

This has **bold then** *italic separately*.

## Nested Strikethrough

The ~~strikethrough with **bold inside**~~ is unusual.

The **bold with ~~strikethrough inside~~** is also valid.

## Inline Code Combinations

Use `code` alongside **bold** and *italic* text.

The function `greet(name)` returns a **string**.

## Complex Inline Mix

A paragraph with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strike~~, and `code` all on one line.

## Links with Formatting

See [**bold link**](https://example.com) and [*italic link*](https://example.com/italic).

## Deeply Nested

***Bold italic*** appears with ~~**bold strike**~~.
