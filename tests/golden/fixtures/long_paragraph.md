This is a very long paragraph that is designed to test the rich text splitting behavior of the notionify SDK. The Notion API limits individual rich text segments to 2000 characters, so any paragraph exceeding this limit must be split into multiple segments while preserving all inline formatting and annotations. This paragraph contains various formatting elements including **bold text** that spans a significant portion, *italic text* that adds emphasis, `inline code` that represents technical terms, and ~~strikethrough~~ for removed content. The paragraph also includes [links to external resources](https://example.com) which must be preserved during splitting. When a rich text segment is split at the 2000-character boundary, the SDK must ensure that no multi-byte characters are broken, no emoji sequences are corrupted, and all annotations that were active at the split point continue correctly in the next segment. This is particularly important for languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean where characters may occupy multiple bytes. The splitting algorithm should prefer to split at word boundaries when possible, but must guarantee that no content is lost regardless of where the split occurs. Additionally, the split must handle edge cases such as formatting markers that straddle the split boundary. For example, if a bold annotation starts before the split point and ends after it, both resulting segments must have the bold annotation applied. The same applies to italic, code, strikethrough, and link annotations. This behavior is critical for round-trip fidelity, as the content must survive conversion to Notion blocks and back to Markdown without any semantic loss. Testing this with a sufficiently long paragraph ensures that the splitting logic handles all these edge cases correctly and that the resulting Notion blocks can be exported back to equivalent Markdown content. The paragraph continues with more text to ensure it exceeds the 2000-character limit and triggers the splitting behavior. Here is some additional content that adds to the overall length of this paragraph. Every sentence contributes to pushing the total character count beyond the threshold. The goal is to verify that even very long paragraphs are handled gracefully by the SDK without any data loss or corruption.
